# Top Down Operator Precedence JavaScript Parser


In Douglas Crockford's article [Top Down Operator Precedence](http://javascript.crockford.com/tdop/tdop.html) 
he implements a parser first presented by Vaughan Pratt. I'll be building the same Parser myself, 
with the hopes of extending it for fun.
