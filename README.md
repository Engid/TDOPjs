# Top Down Operator Precedence JavaScript Parser


In Douglas Crockford's article [Top Down Operator Precedence](http://javascript.crockford.com/tdop/tdop.html) 
he implements a parser first presented by Vaughan Pratt. I'll be building the same Parser myself, 
with the hopes of extending it for fun.  


## Use

As this project is in a very early stage, it has limited useability. It's meant to be run on NodeJS. 
The `buildTree.js` file will take a JS file as an argument, and output the raw JS parse tree 
generated by `parser.js` to the command-line. 


A little test file is included, `test.js`, which looks like:


```javascript

var sweetAdder = function(dawg, fish) {
	var a = [];
	while(dawg < fish){
		dawg = dawg + 1;
		a.push(dawg);		
	}
	return a;
};

var goober = sweetAdder(0, 15);

```



You can run the parser on the `test.js` file (or any [Simplified JavaScript](http://stackoverflow.com/a/4577277)) via


```
$ node buildTree.js test.js
```


The output should look like so:


```

Parsing..
[ { value: '=',
    arity: 'binary',
    first: 
     { value: 'sweetAdder',
       arity: 'name',
       reserved: false,
       nud: [Function: itself],
       led: null,
       std: null,
       lbp: 0,
       scope: [Object] },
    second: 
     { value: 'function',
       arity: 'function',
       first: [Object],
       second: [Object] } },
  { value: '=',
    arity: 'binary',
    first: 
     { value: 'goober',
       arity: 'name',
       reserved: false,
       nud: [Function: itself],
       led: null,
       std: null,
       lbp: 0,
       scope: [Object] },
    second: { value: '(', arity: 'binary', first: [Object], second: [Object] } } ]

```
